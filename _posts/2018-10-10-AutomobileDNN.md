This as well as future projects will follow a specific format
with the data manipulation being in one .py file and the Model defined in another one 
with the respective title.

This is to integrate to the final Library that i plan to make as a wrapper to Tensorflow.

This example has
* imports85.py as the data handler
* DNNRegressor.py as the model handler
